University students social networking database

Problem statement

Due to the pandemic, It has become difficult for students to interact with their colleagues.
As the teaching method is changed from traditional on ground classes to Online classes, many students are not getting the time and chance to interact with each other. “Social Network” is omnipresent in today’s world, even though there are many social networking sites where people can communicate with each other, the only factor missing is the security. While networking, we come across fake profiles due to which people get affected personally and professionally. 
 The idea behind this project is to develop verified student network with other graduate students. So that it gets easier for students to communicate based on the coursework        they have opted for.


Objective


This project aims to help students to create a network with other students depending on the course selected, college wise. This will help them to have a wide range of student networks who can help each other for the betterment of their career growth. Many students feel that using social networking to enhance their personal learning network and to discover resources is very beneficial. Almost every student uses social networking in some form as their daily routine.     
Considering security the major concern for University students, we are aiming to design our project to resolve the security issues caused mainly due to fake identification of profiles and provide a safe and interactive environment for students to network and discuss both course related topics and build networking based on personal interests.
